# Habit-Tracker
 
# Premise
While browsing the app store for habit tracking apps, I was unable to find anything that was straight to the point without requiring subscriptions for the most basic activities. I decided to create my own iOS app using Swift that would fill this gap. The app is not available for download on the app store since I'm am using the Founder sGrotesk font for free under a non-commerical license. Furthermore, the home page design and rest of the app was inspired by the artwork of Purrweb UI/UX Agency on [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/21367995-Habit-Tracker-Mobile-IOS-App).
